Your heart is pounding and it can't be stopped
You tell yourself you're ok
It's too bad your doors can't be locked
To keep the monsters away
You check behind the door
There's nothing there no more
You should've stayed in bed
You've heard this noise before
You dart across the floor
Try not to lose your head
Prepare for the horrors
This night will keep repeating over and over
And over
Until you make it to the end
They hide round the corners
You better peel your eyes and keep looking over
Your shoulder cause you'll never be alone again

First there was one but now there might be three
You turn around just in time
You hear a chuckle and you turn back and see
The closet door's open wide
You look around the space
And see a creepy face
Turns out it's just your toy
But it seems out of place
You leave it just in case
It might be a decoy
Prepare for the horrors
This night will keep repeating over and over
And over, until you make it to the end
They hide round they hide round the corners
You better peel your eyes, and keep look over
Your shoulder cause you'll never be alone again
Prepare for the horrors
This night will keep repeating over and over
And over, until you make it to the end
They hide round they hide round the corners
You better peel your eyes, and keep look over
Your shoulder cause you'll never be alone
This night will keep repeating over and over
And over, until you make it to the end
They hide round they hide round the corners
You better peel your eyes, and keep look over
Your shoulder cause you'll never be alone again
You'll never be alone again
You'll never be alone
