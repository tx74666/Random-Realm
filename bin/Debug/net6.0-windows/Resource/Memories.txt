Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
If you're a lover, you should know
The lonely moments just get lonelier
The longer you're in love
Than if you were alone
Memories turn into daydreams
Become a taboo
I don't want to be afraid
The deeper that I go
It takes my breath away
Soft hearts, electric souls
Heart to heart and eyes to eyes
Is this taboo?
Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I think of you from time to time
More than I thought I would
You were just too kind
And I was too young to know
That's all that really matters
I was a fool
Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Those thoughts of past lovers
They'll always haunt me
I wish I could believe
You'd never ruined me
Then will you remember
Me in the same way
As I remember you?
Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
Baby, we built this house
On memories
Take my picture now
Shake it 'til you see it
And when your fantasies
Become your legacy
Promise me a place
In your house of memories
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh
In your house of memories
Whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Promise me a place
