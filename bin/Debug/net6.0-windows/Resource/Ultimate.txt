Ronny J, listen up
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Woo)
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
Great, eliminate like ElimiDate (Woo)
Hey, young boy had to penetrate (Woo)
Face, young boy done caught a case (Woo)
Bang, now his mama living with the pain (Uh)
Wait, doctor says he's gonna stay (Huh?)
Let him get the senzu bean so he regenerate (Oh)
Now a nigga harder than the head of the state (Damn)
Denzel Curry is the new candidate (Damn)
Ultimate, alternate, you are the opposite
Stop this shit, chop your esophagus (Esophagus)
Bitches be bopping it, bow down and pop it in
Dropping it in her esophagus (Esophagus)
She get so nasty in public, she classy
Perhaps she is able to swallow it (Skrrt)
Girl, I can make you a star (Star)
Then I put her ass on Apollo, bitch (Damn)
Bitch, I am ultimate, behold my awesomeness
Narcissist, part time an arsonist (Damn)
Ripping through cartilage, I am the hardest, bitch
Wrap it up, put in sarcophagus (Damn)
Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm living so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feeling like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics, bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate, bitch I'mâ€”
I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Woo)
By-By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates (Damn)
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put up parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, is he fake, is he real?
What the message is? Chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly dropping melodic
Enter the cosmic flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast (Beast)
Nigga, you tell me who fucking with me (Me)
K to the I to the N to the G (G)
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree (Gree)
Better learn something and get a degree (Gree)
This for Lord Infamous so R.I.P (P)
Arrivederci, bitches looking thirsty
Riding through the dirty, like it's mandatory
Ending of the story
I-I-I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street
Under the sun, the bastard son will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Woo)
By any means, your enemies my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face so now you late, open the gates
