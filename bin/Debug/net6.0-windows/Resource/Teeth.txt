Some days you're the only thing I know
Only thing that's burning when the nights grow cold
Can't look away, can't look away
Beg you to stay, beg you to stay, yeah
Sometimes you're a stranger in my bed
Don't know if you love me, or you want me dead
Push me away, push me away
Then beg me to stay, beg me to stay, yeah
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Some days you're the best thing in my life
Sometimes when I look at you, I see my wife
Then you turn into somebody I don't know
And you push me away, push me away, yeah
Call me in the morning to apologize
Every little lie gives me butterflies
Something in the way you're looking through my eyes
Don't know if I'm gonna make it out alive
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Blood on my shirt, rose in my hand
You're looking at me like you don't know who I am
Blood on my shirt, heart in my hand
Still beating
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Fight so dirty but your love's so sweet
Talk so pretty but your heart got teeth
Late night devil, put your hands on me
And never, never, never ever let go
Teeth
Teeth
Teeth
Never, never, never ever let go
